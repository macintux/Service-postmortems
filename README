Internet services postmortems are educational; let's track 'em.

A quick search didn't reveal any master list, so this is me scratching
my itch.  Currently the only code is a terminal script (Perl) useful
for updating the list, which is contained in a JSON file.

The script will attempt to reject duplicate URLs, and allows for
keywords to be provided with spaces or commas as separators.

Please feel free to submit additional entries.

Eventually this repository could include tools to display, search,
etc.  Don't hold your breath.
